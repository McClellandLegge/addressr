\item{data}{A data.frame or \code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} with at least
a column containing raw addresses}

\item{address_column}{The name of the column containing the addresses}

\item{max_tries}{The maximum iterations to attempt when geocoding, see the Details for more}

\description{
Prepare a raw address by cleaning and validating
}
\details{
The \code{\link[ggmap]{geocode}} function seems to throw spurious `OVER_QUERY_LIMIT`
    errors quite frequently so the `cleanAddress` function has some basic handling
    of these errors, allowing a certain number of retries for those addresses that did
    not get geocoded. When an address is successfully geocoded it will not be
    retried.

    If you do not have a `userid` you should register at \url{https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis}
    before trying to use this function.
